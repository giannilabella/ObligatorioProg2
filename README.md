# Obligatorio Programaci√≥n 2
Application project of ADTs in Java for university's programming 2 subject.  
Made in partnership with: @GuzmanVil

## ADTs
- List
- Queue
- Stack
- Binary search tree
- Heap
- Hash table

## Implementation Comments
Dataset files are open once and all data is loaded into the program.  
Drivers are loaded from `drivers.txt` getting their full names and generating a regular expression later used for verifying its presence in a tweet.  
For Users, the data extracted is their name, favorites count and verification status.
Favorites count is updated if happens to exist another instance of the same user with more favorites in the dataset.  
For Tweets, is extracted their content, date, the User who twitted it and the list of hashtags.
The Hashtags are considerate to be case-insensitive.  
Each one of these entities is managed by its own controller, which are also responsible for the reports.

The DriverController is responsible for the 1st report, in which each tweet is checked for the mention of the drivers, keeping track of the number of mentions individually.
And then the most mentioned are displayed.  
The UserController is responsible for the 2nd and 5th, in the first one, the tweets are iterated and the User's tweet count is incremented for every tweet and then sorted in descendant order.
For the second one it just looks for the most favorited users.  
The HashtagController is responsible for 3rd and 4th reports, in the 3rd it iterates over the tweets, keeping track of every different hashtag found in the tweet that matches the day given.
For the 4th the same is done but keeping track also of the number of uses, later ordering the hashtags used in descendant order.  
The TweetController is responsible for the 6th report, in which it just iterates over the tweets looking for the string given, counting every time it's found.  

## Usage
Files `drivers.txt`, `f1_dataset.csv` and `f1_dataset_test.csv` have to be placed at the project's root.  
Then just run the `MainMenu`
